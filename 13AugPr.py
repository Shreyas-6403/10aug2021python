# Identify the Valid and invalid Operators?

      # < > = Invalid
      # >=  = valid
      #//=  = valid
      # &   = valid

#If i = 3, j = 2 what is the result of following expressions?

i=3
j=2
print ("\n i + 5 >= j – 6",i + 5 >= j - 6) 
print ("\n j * 10 < i ** 2",j * 10 < i ** 2)
print ("\n i < j + 5 > j ** 4",i < j + 5 > j ** 4)
print("\n")
